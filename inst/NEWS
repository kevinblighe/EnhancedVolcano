CHANGES IN VERSION 1.4
------------------------
 - modified behaviour where a p-value of 0 is found: now
   converts these to 10^-1 * lowest non-zero p-value
 - added new paremeter 'legendLabels', which allows user
   to use expressions in the legend label
 - added support for tibbles


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.2
------------------------
 - added functionality to shade specific genes in the plot space (parameters:
   shade, shadeLabel, shadeAlpha, shadeFill, shadeSize, shadeBins)
 - added new parameters 'labhjust' and 'labvjust' for fine tuning position of
   labels
 - suppress warnings about removal of missing values
 - now easier to hide the legend via legendVisible = TRUE/FALSE
 - changed 'colOverride' to 'colCustom'
 - added a new 'shape' parameter to control the shape of plotted points
 - added a new 'shapeCustom' parameter, akin to functionality supplied by
   'colCustom' (formerly 'colOverride')
 - added functionality to add title, subtitle, and caption (parameters: title,
   subtitle, caption, titleLabSize, subtitleLabSize, captionLabSize = 12)
 - added functionality to add extra vertical and horizontal lines (parameters:
   hline, hlineType, hlineCol, hlineWidth, vline, vlineType, vlineCol,
   vlineWidth)
 - changed 'colConnectors' default from "black" to "grey10"
 - added extra parameters for line connectors (parameters: typeConnectors,
   endsConnectors, lengthConnectors)
 - 'labhjust' and 'labvjust' are now 'transcriptLabhjust' and
   'transcriptLabvjust', respectively
 - user can now specify to draw transcript labels as text and text in boxes
   via 'boxedlabels' (TRUE/FALSE)


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0.0
------------------------
 - user can now supply her/his/its own colour vector to label the points
 - default is to now draw grid lines and only have left and bottom borders
 - when selectLab is not NULL, even variables that do not pass the thresholds
   are now labelled along with those that do, even when DrawConnectors is
   either TRUE or FALSE.
 - correctly catches non-numeric x and / or y variables, and throws error.
 - the function now tolerates P values of 0 (zero) and replaces these with the
   lowest possible double value, given a user's specific computer architecture
   and R version.
